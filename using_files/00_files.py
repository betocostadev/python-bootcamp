# We will deal mainly with TXT and CSV files
# Since they are the most common file types in data processing

# TXT files
# Opening a file
# file = open('file.txt', 'r')  # r - read mode
# file = open('file.txt', 'w')  # w - write mode
# file = open('file.txt', 'a')  # a - append mode
# file = open('file.txt', 'r+')  # r+ - read and write mode
# file = open('file.txt', 'w+')  # w+ - write and read mode
# file = open('file.txt', 'a+')  # a+ - append and read mode

# Reading a file
# file = open('file.txt', 'r')
# content = file.read()
# print(content)
# file.close()
