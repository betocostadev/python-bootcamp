# Packages are a way to organize Python modules
# They are directories with a special __init__.py file
# This file can be empty, but it indicates that the directory is a Python package

# To avoid package version conflicts and to manage dependencies, it is recommended to use a virtual environment

# To create an use a virtual environment:
# python3 -m venv .env
# source .env/bin/activate
# pip install package_name

# To deactivate the virtual environment:
# deactivate

# To install a package:
# pip install package_name
