# Python Data Structures
# 3 - Sets
# Sets are unordered collections of unique items.
# Sets are defined by having values between curly brackets { }.
# Set items are unordered, unchangeable, and do not allow duplicate values.
# Sets are mutable, but since they are unordered, indexing has no meaning.
