# Python - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python
# Intro
# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes and objects.
# It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes),
# which are used to create individual instances of objects.
# There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.
