# Python - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Python
# Inheritance
# Inheritance is a powerful feature in object oriented programming.
# It refers to defining a new class with little or no modification to an existing class.
# The new class is called derived (or child) class and the one from which it inherits
# is called the base (or parent) class.
